#### Use the NH11 data set that we loaded earlier.

```{r}
health <- readRDS("NatHealth2011.rds")

#inspect the structure of the data set
str(health)
```

#### Use glm to conduct a logistic regression to predict ever worked (everwrk) using age (age_p) and marital status (r_maritl).
```{r}
#Check the structure and levels of the everwrk field value
str(health$everwrk) # check stucture of hypev
 # check levels of hypev

#clean values that are missing to NA
health$everwrk <- factor(health$everwrk, levels=c("2 No", "1 Yes"))

#confirm values are now cleansed to be jus tyes or no
levels(health$everwrk)
```

```{r}
# Run the regression model, using the above mentioned values (age and marital status)
wrkmodel <- glm(everwrk~age_p+r_maritl,
              data=health, family="binomial")

coef(summary(wrkmodel))

#For example, what we can see with the above coefficient summary is the fact that for marital status' like Divorced, and Living with partner, we have a high coefficient, meaning ever work log odds increase by .73 and .44 respectively. Meaning if you are divorced or living with a partner, you are likely working! Where as something like "Widowed" the ever work log odds would decrease by .68 showing a low probability of working if you are widowed.
```

```{r}
# Since most of us are not used to thinking in log odds this is not too helpful. One solution is to transform the coefficients to make them easier to interpret:

wrkmodel.tab <- coef(summary(wrkmodel))
wrkmodel.tab[, "Estimate"] <- exp(coef(wrkmodel))
wrkmodel.tab

# Predict the probability of working for each level of marital status.
predDat <- with(health$everwrk,
                expand.grid(age_p = c(33, 63),
                            r_maritl = c("Divorced", "Married")))

predDat$r_maritl <- unfactor(obj = predDat$r_maritl)
```

```{r}
# predict hypertension at those levels
predict(wrkmodel, type = "response",
                       se.fit = TRUE, interval="confidence",
                       newdata = predDat)
```
