### Get going by asking the following questions and looking for the answers with some code and plots:

#### Can you count something interesting?
* Count total backorders
* Conditional probability that an item will go on backorder (refer to formula)

#### Can you find some trends (high, low, increase, decrease, anomalies)?
* Is there correlation between lead time and skus that went on backorder(ggplot)
* Correlation between inventory and went on backorder? (ggplot)

#### Can you make a bar plot or a histogram?
* Utilize ggplot to create some charts and graphs (geom_histogram and or geom_bar)

#### Can you compare two related quantities?
* Need clarification of "related?"

#### Can you make a scatterplot?
* ggplot (geom_point)

#### Can you make a time-series plot?
* Over time? 

#### Having made these plots, what are some insights you get from them? Do you see any correlations? Is there a hypothesis you would like to investigate further? What other questions do they lead you to ask?
* TBD
